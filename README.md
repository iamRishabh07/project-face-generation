## Project Overview

In this project, I have used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

# Goal
Generate new faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
The model is trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA):

It generates new human faces. 

## Recommended next steps
* Create a deeper model and use it to generate larger (say 128x128) images of faces.
* Read existing literature to see if you can use padding and normalization techniques to generate higher-resolution images.
* Implement a learning rate that evolves over time.
